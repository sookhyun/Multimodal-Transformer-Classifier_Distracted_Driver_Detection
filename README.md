# Distracted Driver Detection 

## Objectives:

In this project, we develop deep learning classifiers to detect distracted drivers from **multimodal time series** data. The three main algorithms developed are: a Transformer classifier (self-attention encoder), an RNN/LSTM classifier, and a CNN/ResNet classifier.

## Dataset:

FordChallenge from Kaggle.
